# Flappy Bird Clone

## Overview

This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, created entirely by myself using the **Unity Game Engine**. The primary goal of this project was to learn and apply **physics simulation** principles and gain a solid understanding of Unity's core features.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Gameplay:**
  - Simulated realistic bird movement using Unity's Rigidbody2D and Colliders.
- **Simple Yet Engaging Mechanics:**
  - Tap to flap mechanics inspired by the original game.
- **Obstacle Generation:**
  - Procedural spawning of pipes at random heights to create a dynamic and challenging gameplay experience.
- **Scoring System:**
  - Tracks and displays the player's score based on successful navigation through obstacles.
- **Game Over Logic:**
  - Detects collisions and resets the game appropriately.
- **Extra Mechanic:**
  - **Closed Pipes with Unlock Mechanism:** Occasionally, pipes spawn in a "closed" state. The bottom pipe features a yellow "button" (a dome) that can be opened by shooting projectiles. Players must hit the button to open the pipe and continue navigating.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine:** [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- **Language:** C#
- **Physics:** Rigidbody2D for movement and collision detection.

## Key Learnings

- Developed a strong foundation in **Unity basics**, including working with scenes, assets, and prefabs.
- Gained hands-on experience with **physics simulations**, such as forces, gravity, and collisions.
- Improved knowledge of C# scripting in Unity, including event-driven programming and game loop logic.
- Implemented advanced mechanics like **projectile shooting** and interactive obstacles to enhance gameplay.
